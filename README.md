#Crescent Hills Golf Course site sample for dev reasons only 

The project was implemented using the mobile first approach. Used media queries to scale up the layout.

For the mobile model it includes a hamburger menu due to limited available area view, which expands to the full fledged menu when pressed. I included 3 media queries to create a responsive mobile layout/user experience.

## In Summary

1. I include three media queries based on the website design, in order for the website to be responsive and flawlessly display on different devices. This way for example, the main area realines from two columns in the desktop view to one column in mobile view.

2. Project was uploaded to the github repository [ivanmamaliga/EnergyManagementAndDesign](https://github.com/ivanmamaliga/EnergyManagementAndDesign).

3. The website is also published at [CrescentHillsGolf]().

4. Project includes this README file.
