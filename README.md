# Energy Management and Design

The project was implemented using the mobile first approach. Used media queries to scale up the layout.

Based on fictitious enterprise, the website designed to implement the main requirements for the capstone project. The website is designed and build within the responsive, mobile first paradigm. It is build using flexbox, HTML, CSS and JavaScript. The website includes a responsive navigation menu, "hero" image/background, main area with business projects and a energy savings calculator. The calculator should calculate the payoff time period based on investment, yearly project savings and the interest rate.

For the mobile model it includes a hamburger menu due to limited available area view, which expands to the full fledged menu when pressed. I included 3 media queries to create a responsive mobile layout/user experience.

## In Summary

1. I include three media queries based on the website design, in order for the website to be responsive and flawlessly display on different devices. This way for example, the main area realines from two columns in the desktop view to one column in mobile view.

2. Project was uploaded to the github repository [ivanmamaliga/EnergyManagementAndDesign](https://github.com/ivanmamaliga/EnergyManagementAndDesign).

3. The website is also published at [Energy Management and Design](https://ivanmamaliga.github.io/EnergyManagementAndDesign).

4. Project includes this README file.

### Additional features I have used for this project

1. I use the hamburger menu in the mobile version, which expands to full fledge menu upon clicking it.

2. I use flexbox to organize content based on the mobile or desktop device.

3. I use the :nth-child and :hover pseudo classes to decorate the list elements.

4. I use JavaScript to calculate the projects payoff period.

5. I use Javascript to validate the input in the form. If the cells are not populated then an alert will ask the user to populate the form in order to perform the calculation.

6. I also use Javascript to expand the hamburger menu.
